Brief Introduction About Myself 
Hello! My name is Priscilla, I’m 19 years old and currently living in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. I’m a passionate and curious learner, currently enrolled as a Pathway student at ALX. 
During high school, I studied natural science, and that strong academic foundation has shaped my interest in global issues and human development. 
I’ve always had a deep curiosity about how the world works — politically, socially, and culturally — which is why I dream of joining the world of diplomacy one day.
Outside of academics, I enjoy expressing myself creatively. I love reading, making content for social media, and watching movies that spark thought or emotion. 
I’m drawn to storytelling in all its forms and how it connects people across borders. Through my journey, I hope to inspire others, 
especially young African students like me, to follow their passions and pursue big dreams with purpose.
