 My Personal and Academic Goals for Next Year
n the coming year, I am setting clear goals both in my personal life and academic journey. Personally, I aspire to launch a side hustle that not only brings in income 
but also helps me develop practical skills and financial independence. I also aim to grow consistently as a content creator—sharing valuable, 
relatable content that reflects my lifestyle, passions, and personal growth. 
Through this, I hope to build a supportive online community and improve my storytelling and communication skills. Academically,
I am committed to working hard and standing out as a dedicated and high-performing student. I plan to stay focused, 
manage my time wisely, and take every opportunity to deepen my understanding of my field.
Another major goal is to start building a strong resume by getting involved in extracurricular activities, internships, or volunteer 
work that align with my long-term dream of joining the world of diplomacy. By balancing personal growth and academic excellence,
I’m determined to make the next year a foundation for future success
